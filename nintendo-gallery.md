	These tremendous flying fish can be found

	light and vulnerable to Deku Leaf blasts.

Poe

	These undead creatures live only in the

	Effective Weapons:
	 Light Arrows, Master Sword

	This is a phantom that Ganondorf created
	in his own likeness. Use your sword to

	hammer, its tender beak will be revealed.

Darknut
-------

	Habitat: Tower of the Gods
	Spoils: Knight’s Crest

	These mighty knights are protected by
	heavy-duty armor. Rather than attacking

	around behind them and cut their armor off.

Darknut
-------

	Habitat: Earth Temple
	Spoil: Knight’s Crest

	These knights are well protected by their

	Effective Weapon: Light Arrows

	This is a gigantic marionette created by
	Ganon himself. It transforms into three
	different shapes, but all are vulnerable

	to deduce when it can be easily targeted
	and then take advantage of your chance.

Molgera, Protector of the Seal
------------------------------

	Effective Weapon: Hookshot

	This evil guardian burrows deep into sand.

-----

	Habitat: Dragon Roost Island
	Effective Weapon: Grappling Hook

	giant squid in different reaches of the Great

	their weak spots—their eyes—with projectiles
	before being sucked in.

Morthula
--------

	Habitat: Forbidden Woods
	Effective Weapons: Deku Leaf, projectiles

	These high-level mages use the magic of
	summoning to aid them in battle. They are

	Magic: Fire, summons

	These mighty mages are adept at wielding
	flame and summoning other creatures to

	during the brief moments that they assume
	physical form.

Gohdan, The Great Arbiter
-------------------------

	Habitat: Tower of the Gods
	Effective Weapon: Arrows

	This monstrous machine was created by the
	gods as a trial for the great hero. You can
	drop it to the ground only by piercing
